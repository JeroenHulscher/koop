The header component is at the top of every page.

It has various parts:

* logo (which is inside a link)
* a menu bar with 0 or more items
* a section of “Other sites” that can be toggled from the menu bar
* a search field, that can be hidden or shown on page load

The are also two different layouts:

* mobile, where menu bar is hidden on page load, it can be opened with hamburger icon
* desktop, where menu bar is always visible
